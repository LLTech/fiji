This fork of Fiji include optimiszations and modifications by LLTech to allow stitching tiles in headless mode (no log window, no image window)

Optimizations made to [Stitching plugin](http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Stitching_2D/3D) greatly improve the tiles fusion phase (x10 faster)

Also is added an option to compute correlation only on immediate neighbours (not diagonal neighbours), and a condition to exclude tiles that are found too far from their expected positions. These parameters are integrated in StitchImageCollection.

Finally, a standalone program is added to provide a GUI to the headless stitching program.  (just consisting in a window to show that stitching is in progress) 

Work has been divided in two branches: stitching-optims, that we believe to have interest for upstream, and lltech, that has only updates related to integration in LLTech's software

Stitching algorithm  is used by LLTech in itsÂ proprietary acquisition software.
